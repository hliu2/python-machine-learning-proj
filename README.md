# python machine learning project 
## Introduction 
* Try to predict whether a bank client will subscribe a bank term deposit. 
* Conducted Random Forest for feature selection and data preprocessing 
* Applied several Machine Learning algorithms - Decision Tree, SVM, KNN, Logistic Regression, LDA, and QDA - to predict whether clients will subscribe the bank term deposit
* Obtained an optimal model with a remarkable 72.8% testing accuracy  

## Hightlights 
* Data is unbalanced, 5% of all people will buy this product. 
* Defined a f2 score which don't care about accurately discriminating people who don't want to buy this prodcut, but maximize accuracy of discriminating people who want to buy this product.
